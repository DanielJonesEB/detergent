# Assembly Line

A tool for running tasks on and after commit when working with Claude Code. It builds a CLI called `line`. The intention is to run local deterministic tools like linters as pre-commit hooks (called Gates), and then post-commit run Claude Code (or another command) against the new change (these are Stations). Stations run in an ordered list, and are implemented using Git branches.

Rather than expecting an agent to remember to do various checks, a user can 'hard code' a set of prompts to run against every commit. These might include DRYing out code, checking test coverage, updating docs.

## Configuration

The tool is configured with YAML. All commands assume the config file is `line.yaml`; commands that need to reference the config accept `-p`/`--path` to specify a different path. A Git branch to watch must be configured (`watches`).

```yaml
agent:
  command: claude
  args: ["--dangerously-skip-permissions", "--model", "sonnet", "-p"]

settings:
  watches: master

gates:
  - name: lint
    run: "golangci-lint run ./..."

stations:
  - name: deadcode
    prompt: "If you use beads, act on the work immediately and do not exit until those beads have been resolved. Remove any unused code. Do not change any other files and do not push. Don't bother testing, we'll do that later."
  - name: dry
    args: ["--dangerously-skip-permissions", "--model", "haiku", "-p"]
    prompt: "If you use beads, act on the work immediately and do not exit until those beads have been resolved. Deduplicate code. Do not change any other files and do not push. Don't bother testing, we'll do that later."
  - name: test
    args: ["--dangerously-skip-permissions", "--model", "haiku", "-p"]
    prompt: "If you use beads, act on the work immediately and do not exit until those beads have been resolved. Run all the tests, fix any failures. Do not reduce test coverage. Do not change any other files and do not push."
  - name: docs
    prompt: "If you use beads, act on the work immediately and do not exit until those beads have been resolved. Ensure README is up to date with latest features. Don't change any other files and do not push."
```

### Gates

An ordered list of Gates can be configured — each runs as a Git pre-commit hook.

### Stations

- A default agent `command` and `args` can be configured and are shared by all stations.
- Each station can override the agent `command` and/or `args`.
- Each station must have a `prompt`.
- Station names must be unique; each maps to a Git branch (`line/stn/<name>`).

## Commands

### `line init`

- Appends a Git pre-commit hook invoking `line gate`.
- Preserves any existing Git pre-commit hooks.
- Appends a Git post-commit hook invoking `line run`.
- Converges on the desired state — re-running is safe; old or out-of-date config is updated.
- Installs the `/line-rebase` and `/line-preview` skills.
- Configures Claude Code to use `line statusline` for its statusline.
- Adds `.gitignore` entries for any temporary files introduced by assembly-line.

### `line remove`

- Removes the assembly-line blocks from pre-commit and post-commit Git hooks, preserving any other hook content.
- Removes the `/line-rebase` and `/line-preview` skill directories.
- Removes the `statusLine` key from `.claude/settings.json`, preserving other settings.
- Removes the assembly-line block from `.gitignore`, preserving other entries.
- Safe to run even when assembly-line was never initialized (no-op).

### `line run`

- Each station is executed in sequence.
- Each station operates on its own branch; stations must not operate on any other branches.
- Stations must not re-trigger `line run`.
- A default preamble prompt is prepended to each station's configured prompt, instructing the agent not to commit.
- Stations commit any changes made by the invoked agent/command on its branch.
- Stations run in isolated ephemeral Git worktrees under the system temp dir, so the user can keep working in their repo while the line runs.
- Stations 'just work' — if Git state is bad, they catch up to the watched branch and resume.
- Changes to files listed in `.lineignore` (gitignore syntax) do not trigger the line.
- Commits containing `[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`, `[skip line]`, or `[line skip]` in the message do not trigger the line.
- Line runs are independent of rebases on the watched branch.
- If a new commit arrives while the line is running, all agents are stopped, existing station-branch commits are preserved, and the line restarts from the beginning with the latest commit.
- Stations rebase onto their predecessor (not merge) to keep history linear.
- A failed station blocks the line and is reported as 'failed'.

### `line status`

- Prints a headed list of all stations, starting with the watched branch. For each station the shortref of HEAD is shown, along with a dirty-directory indicator.
- Printed before the station list: `⏸` (grey) for an inactive line or `▶` (green) for an active line runner, followed by the config file name.
- Per-station symbols and colour-coded states:
  - ✓ **up to date** — the only commits between the station and the watched branch HEAD are skip-marker commits (green)
  - ● **agent running** — an agent is currently running; shows uptime duration (orange)
  - ○ **pending** — no agent running and station has not yet processed the latest commit (yellow)
  - ✗ **failed** — station encountered an error (red)
- `line status -f` refreshes every two seconds, flicker-free with a hidden cursor.
- Status is computed on-demand rather than cached, so it is trustworthy and reliable.

### `line statusline`

- Shows the same state as `line status` in a single-line format for Claude Code's statusline.
- When the terminal station has commits not yet in the watched branch, prompts the user to use the `/line-rebase` skill to pick them up.
- Provided by the `statusline` subcommand with no external dependencies.

### `/line-rebase` Skill

- Safely stashes any current work on the watched branch, rebases from the terminal station branch to pick up the latest changes, then unstashes work in progress. No work is ever lost.
- Commits picked up onto the watched branch are marked so they do not re-trigger the line.

### `/line-preview` Skill

- Shows a read-only summary of unpicked changes: what each station actually changed (content diffs), not commit history. All derived from Git on-demand with no state files.

### `line schema`

Outputs the YAML configuration schema, intended to help coding agents write valid config.

### `line validate`

Validates `line.yaml` and outputs specific, helpful error messages if the config is invalid. Intended for use by coding agents.

### `line explain`

Outputs succinct but complete usage information about the tool — its purpose, commands, and config — for the benefit of coding agents. Like this README, but always available via CLI.
